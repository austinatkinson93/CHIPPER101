The front-end is developed with React.js & the bootstrap CDN to deliver a cutting edge and responsive UI. Our user interactivity was accomplished with leveraging vanilla Javascript. We assign user-data to a personal identifier number and allow our users to make address, contact, health record and many other changes. The goal was to create an EASY, USER FRIENDLY way to update your contact information. We solve, pets microchip information being delinquent.

# User Solutions

Pet Microchipping has been around since the late 90's, but there has always been one fatal flaw to the system. As a pet owner, it has always & always was a hassle to update your contact information. This one simple issue created a pit-fall for pet reunification. When database information displays delinquent information, such as; old home addresses, old phone numbers or email addresses, the vet or humane society is left with no options. The pet unfortunately falls into the adoption cycle and is almost never reunited with their original family after that point.

Now with the use of CHIPPER and our partnerships with the american humane society & countless veterinarian practices, we have a solution. By allowing our users to update their contact information easily and from their phone or home computer, we lower the number of lost pets. The utilization of our FEED: allows user to stay connected with their local communities, vet practices and humane societys.
