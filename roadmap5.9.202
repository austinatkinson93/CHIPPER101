Admin key generation:
1. Create an admin keys model with two fields:
    -key
    -expired
2. We can just find a site that generates alphanumeric strings (passwordgeenrators are fine for this) and 
   insert it into our admin keys collection with a default esxpired value of "false"
3. Any user that needs a key will need to have it sent to them via email/slack/whatever

Signup form
1. Add a checkbox to signup that says "Sign up as admin"
2. When checked, display an extra form field that says "Admin key"
3. they will need to enter the key that was given to them

POST "/api/signup"
1. IF an admin key was sent in the request body, we check our admin keys collection to see if it exists, and is not expired
     -If it exists, and is not expired, allow user creation AND set isAdmin to true
     -IF user creation is succesful, expire the key, nether api call to update  


ADMIN PAGE 
on componentDidMount / useEffect, check user authentication against some sort of /auth route 
    -IF user.isAdmin is false, redirect to homepage 
    -Otherwise just render the page as if nothing happened
